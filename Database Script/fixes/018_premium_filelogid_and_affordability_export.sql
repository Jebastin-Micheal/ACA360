   018_premium_filelogid_and_affordability_export.sql

   FIXES   Two defects found while diagnosing the ATLANTIC HEALTH PARTNERS 1095-C
           code report. Neither caused that report's problems -- those came from
           the file being filed as plan year 2026 when the data is 2024 -- but
           both are real and both are silent.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   FIX 1   Premium.FileLogId is never populated.

           sp_ImportData_FromStaging inserts Premium rows without FileLogId, so
           every premium row in the database has NULL there. Every other imported
           entity carries it. The consequence is that premiums cannot be traced
           back to the file that produced them, cannot be cleaned up when a file
           is deleted or superseded, and cannot be told apart when the same
           employer is loaded twice.

           The column list gains FileLogId and the SELECT gains @FileLogId.
           Nothing else in that 407-line procedure is touched -- it was patched
           by string replacement against the live definition rather than retyped,
           and the diff is exactly three lines.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   FIX 2   sp_AffordabilityExport reads the wrong payroll columns.

           The importer writes an employee's hourly RATE into payPeriodTotalHours
           and leaves payPeriodHourlyAmount NULL. sp_Generate1095Codes documents
           this convention and reads it correctly. sp_AffordabilityExport reads
           the opposite way round:

               MAX(pr.payPeriodHourlyAmount) AS HourlyRate    -- always NULL
               SUM(pr.payPeriodTotalHours)   AS MonthlyHours  -- actually a rate

           Confirmed against live data: ABERNATHY 21.25, BRENNAN 20.75,
           CASTELLANOS 19.50 all sit in payPeriodTotalHours, and
           payPeriodHourlyAmount is NULL for all twelve employees.

           So the export reports a NULL hourly rate for everybody and reports the
           hourly rate in a column labelled MonthlyHours. Anyone using it to
           check rate-of-pay affordability is reading nonsense.

           Two further faults in the same procedure, fixed here:

             (a) LowestCostPremium took MIN(amount) across EVERY Premium row for
                 the plan, with no filing-year or banding-window filter. On a
                 salary-banded plan that hands every employee the cheapest band --
                 the same shape as the Line 15 fault fixed in script 004. It is
                 now restricted to bands whose window overlaps the filing year.

             (b) W2Wages used SUM(payPeriodSalaryAmount) and ignored
                 payPeriodAdditional. sp_Generate1095Codes uses
                 MAX(salary) + MAX(additional). The two procedures disagreed
                 about the same employee's income. Aligned on the code
                 generator's reading, since that is what drives the actual forms.

   SAFE TO RE-RUN
           Yes. CREATE OR ALTER throughout; the backfill only touches rows whose
           FileLogId is still NULL.
