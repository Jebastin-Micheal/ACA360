   019A_affiliate_plans_replicate.sql          ***  OPTION A -- CANDIDATE  ***

   DO NOT RUN BOTH. This and 019B fix the same bug two different ways. Pick one.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   THE BUG

   CARMEN DELACROIX came out of the code generator as  1H - 2C.

   That pair cannot both be true. 2C means "employee enrolled in the coverage
   offered". 1H means "no offer of coverage was made". She is full time,
   enrolled in MEDICAL PPO CORE with a spouse and a child, and should read
   1E / $165.00 / 2C exactly as SARAH MITCHELL does.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   WHY

   The Plan Information tab is keyed on Primary EIN and nothing else. There is
   no column on it for an affiliate EIN, so sp_ImportData_FromStaging creates
   every plan under the PARENT employer:

       JOIN Employer E ON SP.PrimaryEIN = E.taxid

   Employees, by contrast, are split across employer records by their own EIN:

       COALESCE(Aff.id, @ParentEmployerId)

   So ATLANTIC COASTAL SERVICES LLC (employer 1014) holds two employees and
   zero plans, while all five plans sit under ATLANTIC HEALTH PARTNERS INC
   (1013). The enrolment insert then does this:

       LEFT JOIN EmployerPlan EP ON ...name matches...
                                AND EP.employerId = EC.employerId

   Carmen's EC.employerId is 1014. No plan there. It is a LEFT JOIN, so planId
   lands NULL. EnrolledMo still fires from isEnrolled = 1, giving 2C, while
   PlanId stays NULL, giving 1H. Hence the contradiction.

   A second layer sits behind it: even with the plan resolved,
   sp_Generate1095Codes builds its premium lookup as
   WHERE pr.EmployerId = @EmployerId, and the Premium rows carry 1013, so
   Line 15 would still come out blank for every affiliate employee.

   This is not specific to the test file. ANY client with affiliate EINs has
   every affiliate employee reported as having received no offer of coverage --
   which is the 4980H(a) trigger, the larger of the two penalties, asserted
   against an employer who did in fact offer coverage.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   WHAT OPTION A DOES

   Gives every member of the aggregated group its own copy of the plans, so the
   data matches the shape the rest of the schema already assumes: EmployerPlan
   has an employerId, Premium has an EmployerId, and every procedure that
   touches them filters on it.

   ONE change, in one place: the plan MERGE in sp_ImportData_FromStaging now
   produces a row per (plan x group member) instead of a row per plan. Premiums
   need no change at all -- they already join on name + FileLogId, so they
   replicate onto the new plan rows by themselves.

   Employer.companyId is the parent pointer; the importer already sets it on
   affiliates and leaves it NULL on the parent.

   WHAT IT COSTS
     - Duplicated EmployerPlan and Premium rows, one set per affiliate.
     - Anything that counts plans across a group would double-count. Nothing in
       the current code does, but it is the thing to watch.
     - Check the 1094-C: Part III totals are per member, so this should be
       right, but it is worth confirming against a real aggregated filing.

   WHAT IT BUYS
     - Every downstream procedure works unchanged, including ones not yet
       written. sp_Generate1095Codes, sp_AffordabilityExport, the XML builder
       and the penalty dashboard all keep their simple employerId filter.
     - The 265-line code generator is not touched at all.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   BUILT ON SCRIPT 018. The procedure below already contains 018's fix (the
   Premium insert carrying FileLogId). Run 018 first, or run this instead of
   its Part 1 -- either way this version is the later one.

   The procedure was patched by string replacement against the live definition
   rather than retyped. The only difference from what runs today is the plan
   MERGE join, plus 018's two Premium lines.

   AFTER RUNNING: regenerate the codes for both employers, then re-export.
